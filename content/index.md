Agency Matters is a publication about **user agency** in software.

User agency, in the context of software, is the user's ability to make meaningful choices to control their experience in a digital environment.

The format is something between a publication, digital garden, and knowledge base.

The goal is to explore the concept of User Agency in technology by examining emerging technologies and software subcultures in terms of whether they espose user agency as a goal, and the degree to which user agency is imbued in their software.

In as much as this is a philosophical, it aims to equally be practical, giving advice based on real world usage.

Software is playing a significant role in shaping and influencing our lives and reality. It empowers us, but we're also dependent on it. In a sense, software is mediating the connection between the physical world and cyberspace. As such, it's imperative to use it and engage with it meaninfully, so it serves us rather than us serving it, or some hidden algorithmic incentive loop.
